Driving 55 in my Porsche down the Hauptstrasse in Berlin, heading straight to the new Biergarten along the way to the Flughafen, after Ratskeller hopping, with my posse in tow in their BMW and another in their Audi, reminiscing about our last wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst and Brot chomping contest in vintage Lederhose, we daydream lazily in our Klimaanlage, lost in our own reverie of Rammstein music.
It was then I saw a woman, who looked just like the famous mathemetician Gauss, wearing the most outlandish Dirndel that I've ever seen.
She was standing outside an incredible looking Schloss, looking like it borrowed architectural styles from Munich. 
I thought, "Man, that Schloss is so big, the klimaanlage bill must be astronomical!"
